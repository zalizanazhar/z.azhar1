                    <h2>Laser Cutting</h2>
                    <p>For the laser cutting assignment , the task was to make a music box with the dimensions given.The making of the hinges of the box was tricky but i figured it out by refering to online tutorials.
                        After i designed the box and seperated the 6 faces, i transferred it into autocad .I cleaned the design up abit in auto cad , before importing svg files of nordic like designs from a online website
                        to complete the box . 
                </p>
                    <img src="image1/box design.PNG" width="510" height="300">
                    <p>This is the final design to be printed </p>
                     <img src="image1/face1.PNG" width="510" height="300">
                    <p>This is the bigger face of the side the box.  </p>
                     <img src="image1/face2.PNG" width="510" height="300">
                    <p>This is the smaller face of the side of the box. </p>
                     <img src="image1/face3.PNG" width="510" height="300">
                    <p> This is the top cover of the box.</p>
                    <h2>How i can Improve.</h2>
                     <p>For the top cover of the box the design at the 4 edges are not as clear as they are to small and complex.
                    during the laser cuttng process ,the laser could not adjust to the size of the smaller design at the edges causing it to look burn and not as defined . 
                    This mistake is due to not taking into account the size and comlexity of the small design which is a mistake i wont make in the future. </p>
