					<h2>3D Printing Assignment</h2>
					<p>For my 3D printing design i used fusion 360. For my design the functions i used were extrude , importing svg and hollow . 
					I started the project, building the base by extruding a bunch of circles and chamfering the corners to give me the chess piece look.
					I then imported a horse svg stencil to use as reference . </p>

					<p> For my chess piece design , there was supposed to be a sort of dragon design texture on its neck but the outcome was not favourable as
					i did not take into account how it will be printed and should have added supporting structures .</p>
					<h2>How i can improve</h2>
					<p>Reflecting and learning from this project , what i would do differently in the future would be to visualise and plan more instead of winging it 
					and to understand the physics of how the 3d printer prints to prevent future mistakes.</p>
